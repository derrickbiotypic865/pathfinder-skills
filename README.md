# Pathfinder

Skills, teaching materials, and resources that turn non-technical people into AI-native builders.

> *"We are not caretakers of the past. We are obsessive learners, compulsive experimenters, and builders of what's next."*

This is for people who believe the AI-native future will be built not only by developers, but by business people who learn to build. We focus on obsessive learners and eager experimenters — people who embrace the discomfort of exploring unknown unknowns and who will forge the path for others.

We promise to help them gain the superpower of **building** — the ability to create their own automations, apps, and agents, and to use that power where it delivers the greatest possible impact.

**What's inside:**
- **18 Claude Code skills** — from understanding your first command to building your own agents
- **Teaching materials** — workshop plans, train-the-trainer kits, teaching guides
- **Real-world patterns** — battle-tested code patterns from production Apps Script projects
- **The journey** — a structured path from "I've never opened a terminal" to "I just built an agent that reimagined our workflow"

## Getting Started — Just 5 Commands

You don't need to remember 18 skills. Just use these:

| Command | What it does |
|:--------|:-------------|
| `/pathfinder` | **Start here.** The master router — tells you what's available, detects what you need, and activates the right skill automatically. Or just talk naturally and it figures it out. |
| `/learn` | **Understand things.** Turns on plain-English explanations, courage mode, and surfaces things you didn't know to ask about. |
| `/build` | **Create things.** Find what to automate, form a hypothesis, build a rough v1 fast, connect APIs, level up to agents. |
| `/reflect` | **Capture learnings.** Journal what you built, what broke, what you learned. Measure time saved and ROI. |
| `/share` | **Multiply impact.** Generate shareable summaries, how-to guides, presentations, and workshop plans. Teach others to build. |

Or skip the commands entirely — just say what's on your mind and Pathfinder routes you to the right tool.

## The Skills (18)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>courage-mode</strong> — For when you're stuck or afraid to start</summary>

Detects when you're hesitant, overwhelmed, or afraid of breaking something, then gently guides you forward with tiny, safe steps.

**Key features:**
- **Hesitation detection**: Recognizes phrases like "I'm scared", "this is too hard", "what if I break something"
- **Reframing**: Turns "I'm stuck" into "You're at the edge of what you know — that's where growth happens"

- **Comfort analogies**: "Remember the first time you used a spreadsheet? That felt hard too."

**Say**: "I'm stuck", "I'm scared", "help me start", "this is too hard", "I can't do this"

</details>

### The Learning Loop

<details>
<summary><strong>hypothesis-lab</strong> — Structure every project as an experiment</summary>

Turns every project into a structured experiment so you learn whether your idea actually works — not just whether the code runs.

**Key features:**
- **Hypothesis framework**: "If [we build this], then [this outcome], because [this reason]"
- **Assumption surfacing**: Lists every assumption and labels them `[VERIFIED]`, `[UNTESTED]`, or `[RISKY]`
- **Success criteria**: Defines measurable outcomes before building
- **Minimum test**: Builds the smallest possible version that tests the hypothesis
- **Evidence gathering**: Returns to the hypothesis after building — did it match? What surprised us?
- **Iteration or pivot**: Uses evidence to decide — confirm, adjust, or try something else
- **Experiment log**: Running tracker of all experiments, results, and learnings across sessions

**Say**: "I have an idea", "I want to build something", "let's try something", "what if we..."

</details>

<details>

Gets a rough working version into your hands in minutes, then coaches you through improving it. The first version is supposed to be ugly.

**Key features:**
- **60-second capture**: Asks exactly ONE question — "What do you want to build?" — then starts building immediately
- **Simplest tool selection**: Picks the easiest path (Apps Script, Python, HTML) and explains why
- **Rough v1**: Builds fast with hardcoded values, no error handling, no edge cases — intentionally imperfect
- **Break-and-learn loop**: Run it, see what happens, make ONE change, repeat
- **Anti-pattern redirection**: Gently steers away from perfectionism — "Let's handle that in v2"
- **Progress celebration**: "Look at what you just did — you went from an idea to a working thing in 10 minutes"

**Say**: "let's just build it", "start building", "I want a quick prototype", "just make something"

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>unknown-unknowns</strong> — Discover what you didn't know to ask</summary>

After any build or exploration, proactively surfaces adjacent ideas, hidden risks, and unexpected opportunities you haven't considered.

**Key features:**
- **Adjacent capabilities**: "Your script can also create calendar events, not just read them"
- **Edge cases**: "What happens when the spreadsheet is empty?"
- **Scale questions**: "This works for 10 rows — what happens at 10,000?"
- **Connection opportunities**: "This data also exists in another system — you could pull from both"
- **Security awareness**: "This script has access to your entire Gmail — worth understanding the permissions"
- **Depth adaptation**: Adjusts based on experience level — beginners get opportunities, advanced get architecture questions
- **Never overwhelming**: Maximum 3 unknown unknowns at a time, each framed as an opportunity

**Say**: "what am I missing?", "what else?", "what could go wrong?", "surprise me"

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>iteration-journal</strong> — Track your growth as a builder</summary>

A structured reflection tool that captures what you built, what broke, what you learned, and what to try next. Tracks growth over time.

- **Weekly summaries**: Aggregates entries and surfaces patterns — "Your confidence with APIs went from 2 to 4 this week"
- **Growth visualization**: Tracks mastered topics, developing skills, and confidence trajectories
- **Look-back feature**: "Show me what I was working on a month ago" — demonstrates your progress

**Say**: "journal", "reflect", "what did I learn today?", "weekly summary", "look back"

</details>

### The Builder Tools

<details>
<summary><strong>workflow-detective</strong> — Find the highest-value thing to automate</summary>

Investigates your daily work to uncover repetitive tasks, bottlenecks, and pain points, then helps you decide what to build first.

<details>
<summary><strong>api-explorer</strong> — APIs are friendlier than they look</summary>

Demystifies APIs for non-technical people, from "what is an API?" to making your first call to connecting work systems.

**Key features:**
- **Core analogy**: "An API is like a drive-through window — you place an order in a specific format and get back exactly what you asked for"
- **HTTP methods explained**: GET = "asking a question", POST = "submitting a form", PUT = "updating your address", DELETE = "canceling an order"

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>agent-architect</strong> — Graduate from scripts to agents</summary>

Guides you from simple automations to building your own agents through six progressive levels, each with a concrete project.

**Key features:**
- **Core analogy**: "An agent is like hiring a virtual assistant who follows your exact instructions"
- **Six levels**:
  - Level 1: A script that checks and acts ("if inbox has email from X, move to folder Y")
  - Level 2: Multi-step workflows (do A, then B, then C)
  - Level 3: Decision logic (if this, do that; otherwise do something else)
  - Level 4: Error handling and recovery
  - Level 5: Connecting multiple systems
  - Level 6: Full agent — autonomous, scheduled, self-monitoring
- **Gradual concept introduction**: APIs, webhooks, scheduling, state management, logging — each with a real-world analogy
- **Milestone moment**: "You just built your first agent. It's small, but it's real."

**Say**: "build an agent", "level up", "what's an agent?", "I want to build something smarter"

</details>

```

## Installation

### Option 1: Install all skills as a Plugin (recommended)

```bash
/plugin install ChewbaccaRoars/pathfinder-skills
```

### Option 2: Install individual skills manually

```bash
# Replace <skill-name> with any skill from the list above
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>
cp skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

### Option 3: Project-level (shared with your team via git)

```bash
# Copy all skills into your project
cp -r skills/ .claude/skills/
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "Add Pathfinder skills"
```

### Enable the Welcome Message (optional but recommended)

Copy the example CLAUDE.md to your home directory so Pathfinder greets you on every new session:

```bash
cp CLAUDE.md.example ~/CLAUDE.md
```

This shows the quick menu (`/learn`, `/build`, `/reflect`, `/share`) when you start a new Claude Code session. Without it, the skills still work — you just won't get the welcome prompt.

## Quick Start

1. Install the plugin (see above)
2. Start a new Claude Code session
3. Tech Translator will ask if you want it always-on, on-demand, or off
4. Say "what should I build?" to start with Workflow Detective
5. Say "let's build it" to jump into Build First, Break Later
6. Say "what did I learn?" at the end to reflect with Iteration Journal

## Values

These skills are built on a set of beliefs:

- **Learning is not optional.** It's how we grow, adapt, and improve.
- **We learn by doing.** Not by reading. Not by watching. By building.
- **We begin with hypotheses, not certainties.** We test what we believe. We let evidence sharpen our thinking.
- **We respect the unknown.** The best discoveries come from questions we didn't know to ask.
- **We are teachers.** Knowledge grows when it's shared. People grow when they're believed in.
- **We seek transformative outcomes.** We're not here to preserve the status quo. We're here to create meaningful change.
